1.4149647826034966,@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews I fail to see how you think a choice is equal to killing the elderly. Involuntary euthanasia isn't a thing. That's just murder. But then the choice to be euthanised isn't there either so maybe you should think about that cause first?

2.3813561455036867,@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews No one said about the delivery of an unborn baby... It would poison the mother if it wasn't removed.

1.9348559499070461,@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews I think you best read up a little more. Lungs and kidneys still need to develop through the entirety of the pregnancy. https://t.co/Wf2zVOopJM
2.344811504190548,@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Contraception isn't 100% effective. Therefore a couple trying their best to avoid pregnancy could end up with an unwanted pregnancy. 
1.6562662130820762,But you'll risk the well-being of a premature baby born at 23 weeks because it kicked? It doesn't have the organs to survive alone...
2.226283160649905,@RuthMarieLand @Trish_Jones_ @BBCNews I'm sorry you had to go through that. The right to a safe abortion should be available to every woman.
1.8306977023876725,@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Thanks for informing me on how a human is created... But frankly a foetus cannot survive outside a womb until around 25 weeks. That is no life. 
1.5309783402066461,I suppose you're someone who believes contraception is wrong too?
1.9311102942787046,@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews Yet women aren't all given help. You're not killing a baby... It's not alive until it is born

1.7303422706687126,@Trish_Jones_ @RuthMarieLand @BBCNews I'm not sure if you know the OP but she could have been at risk due to something wrong with the mother rather than the unborn. It happens so often. -_- since when did the rights of women men less than something that cannot survive on its own?

1.885657785198938,@KevinShau Can you provide evidence? I'd argue it was on the decline slowly and the legislation speeded up the decline

1.5359531198422829,@Zeitgeist24_7 I just sort of want to think Smith wasn�۪t that involved. He has always seemed a decent person to me but maybe you are right.
1.7526684330042825,Things don�۪t go there way. From what I understand just like in other sports cricketers get together after the sport had finished and enjoy the company of the opposition except when playing Oz!
1.4776599771576429,Ok one more thing. If we accept that Lehmann wasn�۪t involved surely he has to accept some blame for the culture that saw the team thrive on being hated. The Millwall of cricket. The Ashes will always be spicy yet oz seem to make enemies everywhere they go and then complain when..

1.6667445609432783,Different to 2011. England players couldn�۪t relax off the pitch and midnight curfew was introduced. They even laughed along with the Barmy Army realising it�۪s harder for fans to target players M Johnson style when they seem to be enjoying it. They just showed no weakness.
1.7048931987447749,Finally I thought Australia were amazing off the field during the Ashes. They would have always won but they got inside the England players heads
1.4077424691027765,I don�۪t understand why Bancroft would decide to align himself with Warner. All too strange #sandpapergate
0.8303415252028135,Only Warner was missing I noticed how close knit they were. Of course they were happy but they seemed comfortable together. Also Smith was totally in control
1.0393483217343427,All the team were there including a few wives except for WARNER. They soon realised who we were but the vibe was generally positive and a few players asked us to sing some songs and had a laugh with us. Smith and his wife were there and Bancroft was there too. As well as noting..
1.8571798295334954,On the night Oz won the Ashes I was with Barmy Army in Perth Casino. As it was past midnight this was the only place open in Perth and only one bar was open in there. Soon after arriving at the bar the Aussie team arrived

1.45065181387446,No longer seem to. It�۪s not just a middle class sport like in England and they don�۪t have football academy that snap up any sporty 6 yr old and make their focus just football. But when I lived in NZ I rarely met a Kiki who cared about cricket
